<h2>Who</h2>
<p>I am a freelance Django developer with more than a decade of Python experience and a strong foundation in JavaScript programming. Besides fullstack web development, my specialties are web scraping and geospatial programming. I'm excited by the new async/await syntax in Python 3.5. My hobbies include reading comics, learning Chinese, <a href="http://megafeihong.tumblr.com">drawing</a>, and dragon boat racing.</p>
<h2>Experience</h2>
<p><strong>Freelance</strong>, June 2013 to present</p>
<p>I have helped a number of clients with their Python and JavaScript web development needs. On the odd occasion I've also done iOS work in Objective-C.</p>
<p><a href="http://everyblock.com">EveryBlock</a>, September 2011 to Februrary 2013</p>
<p>I worked on a large Django site with a strong geographic focus. We had a PostgreSQL backend and used Celery for tasks. In particular I focused on scraping and presentation of external datasets in various formats including web pages, structured files, APIs, and even PDFs. I also helped create an internal system for the timely detection of scraping errors.</p>
<p><a href="http://leapfrogonline.com">Leapfrog Online</a>, May 2008 to September 2011</p>
<p>I worked on a large Pylons app for managing ad campaigns, which had a complex GUI written in ExtJS and jQuery. Later I switched to developing a large Django app for executing cable promotions. My unique contribution was introducing frontend tests to the development process, using QUnit and PunkyBrowster.</p>
<p><a href="http://morningstar.com">Morningstar</a>, August 2005 to January 2008</p>
<p>I worked on an ASP.NET app to extract data from a SQL Server database and display it as XML to end users. I also created a Python command line program to generate hundreds of T-SQL queries, ushering in the official use of Python at the company.</p>
