Who
---

I am a freelance Django developer with more than a decade of Python experience and a strong foundation in JavaScript programming. Besides fullstack web development, my specialties are web scraping and geospatial programming. I'm excited by the new async/await syntax in Python 3.5. My hobbies include reading comics, learning Chinese, [drawing](http://megafeihong.tumblr.com), and dragon boat racing.

Experience
----------

**Freelance**, June 2013 to present

I have helped a number of clients with their Python and JavaScript web development needs. On the odd occasion I've even done some iOS work.

[EveryBlock](http://everyblock.com), September 2011 to Februrary 2013

I worked on a large Django site with a strong geographic focus. We had a PostgreSQL backend and used Celery for tasks. In particular I focused on scraping and presentation of external datasets in various formats including web pages, structured files, APIs, and even PDFs. I also helped create an internal system for the timely detection of scraping errors.

[Leapfrog Online](http://leapfrogonline.com), May 2008 to September 2011

I worked on a large Pylons app for managing ad campaigns, which had a complex GUI written in ExtJS and jQuery. Later I switched to developing a large Django app for executing cable promotions. My unique contribution was introducing frontend tests to the development process, using QUnit and PunkyBrowster.

[Morningstar](http://morningstar.com), August 2005 to January 2008

I worked on an ASP.NET app to extract data from a SQL Server database and display it as XML to end users. I also created a Python command line program to generate hundreds of T-SQL queries, ushering the official use of Python at Morningstar.

Talks
-----

[Using Tasks in Your Asyncio Web App](https://github.com/feihong/asyncio-tasks-talk), September 2016

I cover how to implement different types of tasks in an asyncio-based web application, including how to start them, stop them, and send incremental data to a web frontend using websockets. I also spend a little time reviewing asyncio concepts.


[Using Realm with Swift](https://github.com/feihong/realm-talk), March 2015

Realm is a mobile database for iOS and Android. On iOS, it's meant to be a replacement for Core Data, offering a similar API but with better performance and a smaller footprint.

[Asynchronous I/O in Python 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMgRUI7V_mk), July 2013

An overview of PEP 3156 and basic usage of the reference implementation, codenamed Tulip. This is now known as asyncio, and is currently in the Python 3 standard library.

[Scraping from the Web: An Overview That Does Not Contain Too Much Cussing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMgRUI7V_mk), February 2013

I discuss how we implemented various scrapers at EveryBlock.
